# Research Proposal: Multi-Objective Optimization Under Uncertainty for Integrated Business Planning on TFT-LCD Industry

## 1. Research Problem Statement

### 1.1 Problem Definition
Integrated Business Planning (IBP) requires simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives (cost minimization, service level maximization, inventory turnover, sustainability metrics) under various uncertainties (demand volatility, supply disruptions, capacity constraints). Current IBP systems either:

1. **Oversimplify** by optimizing single objectives or using weighted sum approaches
2. **Ignore uncertainty** by using deterministic models with point forecasts
3. **Lack adaptability** to changing business priorities and market conditions
4. **Fail to provide interpretable trade-offs** for decision makers

Integrated Business Planning (IBP) in industries like TFT-LCD manufacturing requires optimizing conflicting objectives—cost minimization, service level maximization, inventory turnover, and sustainability metrics—under uncertainties such as demand volatility, supply disruptions, capacity constraints, price fluctuations, and geopolitical risks. For example, TFT-LCD firms face short product lifecycles (6–12 months) and price drops (up to 30% annually), necessitating agile inventory strategies. Current IBP systems often:

Oversimplify by focusing on single objectives (e.g., cost) or using static weighted sums.
Ignore uncertainties like chip shortages or port congestion (e.g., 2021 disruptions).
Lack adaptability to rapid market shifts (e.g., demand spikes for 4K panels).
Fail to provide interpretable trade-offs for stakeholders (e.g., planners, executives).

# Integrated Business Planning (IBP)

## **Core Definition**

**Integrated Business Planning (IBP)** is a comprehensive, cross-functional business process that systematically aligns and synchronizes strategic objectives, operational plans, and financial targets across an organization's entire value chain to optimize enterprise-wide performance under uncertainty (Grimson & Pyke, 2007; Oliver Wight, 2019).

## **Conceptual Framework**

IBP represents an evolution from traditional Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) by expanding the planning horizon, scope, and integration depth to encompass:

### **1. Multi-Dimensional Integration**
- **Horizontal Integration:** Coordination across functional silos (sales, operations, finance, procurement, marketing)
- **Vertical Integration:** Alignment from strategic planning to operational execution
- **Temporal Integration:** Synchronization of short-term operations with long-term strategic goals
- **Supply Chain Integration:** End-to-end coordination from suppliers to customers (Tuomikangas & Kaipia, 2014)

### **2. Planning Scope and Horizon**
IBP extends beyond traditional 18-month operational planning to encompass:
- **Strategic Planning:** 3-5 year strategic horizon alignment
- **Financial Planning:** Budget and resource allocation integration
- **Portfolio Management:** Product lifecycle and innovation pipeline coordination
- **Risk Management:** Uncertainty and scenario planning incorporation (Cecere et al., 2009)

## **Defining Characteristics**

### **Process Characteristics:**
1. **Cross-Functional Governance:** Structured decision-making involving all business functions
2. **Scenario-Based Planning:** Multiple future state modeling and contingency planning

## **Academic Perspectives**

### **Operations Management View:**
IBP is conceptualized as a "**planning integration mechanism**" that reduces organizational silos and improves demand-supply matching through structured coordination processes (Oliva & Watson, 2011).

### **Strategic Management View:**
IBP functions as a "**strategic capability**" enabling organizations to translate strategic intent into executable operational plans while maintaining adaptability to environmental changes (Goh & Eldridge, 2015).

### **Information Systems View:**
IBP represents a "**socio-technical system**" combining organizational processes, technological infrastructure, and human decision-making to achieve planning optimization (Jonsson & Mattsson, 2009).

## **Theoretical Foundations**

### **Systems Theory Perspective:**
IBP embodies systems thinking by treating the organization as an interconnected network where:
