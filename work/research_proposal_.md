# Research Proposal: Multi-Objective Optimization Under Uncertainty for Integrated Business Planning on TFT-LCD Industry

## 1. Research Problem Statement

### 1.1 Problem Definition
Integrated Business Planning (IBP) requires simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives (cost minimization, service level maximization, inventory turnover, sustainability metrics) under various uncertainties (demand volatility, supply disruptions, capacity constraints). Current IBP systems either:

1. **Oversimplify** by optimizing single objectives or using weighted sum approaches
2. **Ignore uncertainty** by using deterministic models with point forecasts
3. **Lack adaptability** to changing business priorities and market conditions
4. **Fail to provide interpretable trade-offs** for decision makers

Integrated Business Planning (IBP) in industries like TFT-LCD manufacturing requires optimizing conflicting objectives—cost minimization, service level maximization, inventory turnover, and sustainability metrics—under uncertainties such as demand volatility, supply disruptions, capacity constraints, price fluctuations, and geopolitical risks. For example, TFT-LCD firms face short product lifecycles (6–12 months) and price drops (up to 30% annually), necessitating agile inventory strategies. Current IBP systems often:

Oversimplify by focusing on single objectives (e.g., cost) or using static weighted sums.
Ignore uncertainties like chip shortages or port congestion (e.g., 2021 disruptions).
Lack adaptability to rapid market shifts (e.g., demand spikes for 4K panels).
Fail to provide interpretable trade-offs for stakeholders (e.g., planners, executives).


### 1.2 Research Goals
**Primary Research Question:**
1. How to build a robust optimization framework
2. How can AI help to solve multi-objective optimization problems under uncertainty in IBP for TFT-LCD manufacturing, providing interpretable trade-offs for planners and executives while adapting to dynamic market conditions?
3. How uncertainty analysis and optimization modeling (UAO) can be used as tools to enhance supply chain resilience in various supply chain contexts?
                  

**Secondary Research Questions:**

1. What are the most effective methods for quantifying uncertainties (e.g., demand, supply, price) in TFT-LCD IBP optimization?
2. How can algorithms dynamically adjust objective weights based on market signals (e.g., panel price drops, chip shortages)?
3. What trade-offs exist between solution quality, computational efficiency, and interpretability for multi-stage TFT-LCD production (array, cell, module)?
4. How do uncertainty modeling approaches impact decision quality in real-world TFT-LCD scenarios (e.g., managing obsolescence risks)?

### How do they work together?

 How Can They Complement Each Other?

1. NSGA-III + BMOO (Bayesian)

Combine global exploration and Pareto front diversity from NSGA-III with sample-efficient modeling from BMOO.

	•	Use Case: Expensive simulations or experiments (e.g., physical manufacturing tests)
	•	Hybrid Strategy:
	•	Use BMOO in early stages to reduce evaluation cost
	•	Switch to NSGA-III when enough data is collected to explore the Pareto front more broadly

2. NSGA-III + RSP

Inject robustness and uncertainty modeling into the deterministic Pareto search of NSGA-III.

	•	Use Case: You want not just optimal but also robust under variability solutions (e.g., supply chain planning, TFT manufacturing yield)
	•	Hybrid Strategy:
	•	Run NSGA-III to get Pareto front
	•	Post-process or re-rank with RSP to evaluate sensitivity under uncertain scenarios
	•	Alternatively, embed robustness metrics as additional objectives in NSGA-III

3. BMOO + RSP

For cases where evaluations are expensive and uncertainty is critical, this pair excels.

	•	Use Case: Black-box functions with uncertain parameters (e.g., AI models trained with variable data)
	•	Hybrid Strategy:
	•	Use BMOO to explore the objective space while modeling uncertainty
	•	Use RSP to bias search towards stable solutions

“Multi‑Objective Stochastic Programming Approaches for Supply Chain Management”
A strategic‑tactical two-stage model is proposed, where supply chain design decisions (facility location, flows) are optimized across multiple objectives—including expected cost, cost variance, and downside risk—under uncertain demand, supply reliability, and transportation costs. The model is solved via interactive techniques like goal‑attainment and surrogate-worth trade‑offs. This work exemplifies how stochastic programming can formally account for risk and uncertainty, offering a foundational basis for RSP in supply chain IBP  ￼.

Azaron, Furmans & Modarres (2010)

“Multi‑Objective Stochastic Programming Approaches for Supply Chain Management”
A strategic‑tactical two-stage model is proposed, where supply chain design decisions (facility location, flows) are optimized across multiple objectives—including expected cost, cost variance, and downside risk—under uncertain demand, supply reliability, and transportation costs. The model is solved via interactive techniques like goal‑attainment and surrogate-worth trade‑offs. This work exemplifies how stochastic programming can formally account for risk and uncertainty, offering a foundational basis for RSP in supply chain IBP  ￼.

🧠 Integrated Literature Review Section

2.x Literature on Robust/Stochastic and Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization

Robust/Stochastic Programming (RSP)
Azaron et al. (2010) present a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming framework aimed at supply chain design that explicitly models uncertainty in demand, supply reliability, and logistics costs. By optimizing expected cost, variance, and downside risk using techniques like goal-attainment and surrogate-worth trade-offs, they offer insight into balancing performance with risk under uncertainty—aligning closely with the goals of TFT‑LCD IBP under volatile pricing and lead times  ￼.

Building on this, Felfel et al. (2018) apply stochastic programming in a multi-site textile supply chain with price uncertainties. They optimize for both expected profit and financial risk (CVaR/downside risk) in a Pareto framework, demonstrating industry-grade applicability of stochastic IBP planning in environments with price volatility—highly analogous to TFT‑LCD contexts  ￼.

Maggioni et al. (2025) introduce scenario-based sampling methods for robust multi-stage optimization that improve computational scalability and offer probabilistic guarantees. Their work provides a modern foundation for implementing robust constraints and CVaR objectives within RSP for IBP under dynamic uncertainty sets  ￼.

⸻

Evolutionary Multi‑Objective / EMOO
Napalkova & Merkurjeva (2012) offer a hybrid simulation-based EMOO approach for multi-echelon supply chain planning. Their methodology leverages stochastic discrete-event simulation, evolutionary algorithms, response surface modelling, and compromise programming to produce Pareto-optimal solutions. This aligns directly with the EMOO/NSGA-III framework you propose, particularly when simulation-based data generation is employed in TFT‑LCD inventory optimization  ￼.

⸻

🔖 Literature Gaps & Integration Rationale
	•	EMOO tools like NSGA‑III have been applied in simulation-heavy supply chain scenarios but are rarely integrated with robust uncertainty modeling or real-time risk objectives.
	•	BMOO remains under-documented in supply chain literature, but holds promise for sample-efficient multi-objective optimization where simulation cost or experimental evaluation is high.
	•	RSP methods, while rigorous, often lack diversity-promoting Pareto exploration and may yield overly conservative solutions when used alone.
	•	A unified framework that combines:
	1.	EMOO for diversity and many-objective exploration,
	2.	BMOO for sample-efficient surrogate guidance, and
	3.	RSP for explicit robustness under uncertainty,
is currently missing in TFT‑LCD IBP research and represents a novel contribution the proposal can fill.

## Appendix (B) Sample Artifact: Uncertainty QuantificationT
The **Tool Integration** section for **Approach 1: Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMOO)** in the research proposal to incorporate **open-source tools** instead of proprietary ones like SAP IBP. The revised section will align with the TFT-LCD context, addressing the inventory-lateness conflict in multi-objective optimization under uncertainty, and leverage insights from the provided web results. I’ll also ensure the tools are practical for TFT-LCD supply chain planning and integrate seamlessly with the EMOO framework. Additionally, I’ll provide an updated artifact (Python code) to support the EMOO approach using one of the open-source tools.

### Revised Tool Integration for EMOO (Approach 3.1)

**Objective**: Replace proprietary tools (e.g., SAP IBP) with open-source alternatives for the **Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMOO)** approach, tailored to TFT-LCD manufacturing’s multi-objective optimization needs (cost minimization, service level maximization, inventory turnover, sustainability) under uncertainties (demand volatility, supply disruptions, price fluctuations).

**Original Tool Integration (for Reference)**:
- **SAP IBP**: Used to input demand forecasts and supplier data for TFT-LCD components (e.g., driver ICs, glass substrates).
- **Pymoo**: Python library for implementing NSGA-III to optimize IBP objectives.

**Enriched Tool Integration (Open-Source Focus)**:
- **Pymoo**: Retain as the core open-source library for implementing NSGA-III, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm suitable for TFT-LCD’s complex objectives (e.g., balancing cost and service level for driver IC inventory).
  - **Why**: Pymoo is open-source, actively maintained ([github.com/anyoptimization/pymoo](https://github.com/anyoptimization/pymoo)), and supports NSGA-III with customizable fitness functions for uncertainty-aware optimization.
  - **TFT-LCD Application**: Optimize inventory levels (e.g., 1-week buffer for ICs), production schedules, and procurement plans under demand volatility (±20%) and lead time uncertainty (14 ± 4 days).
  - **Implementation**: Use Pymoo to define objectives (e.g., minimize cost: $5K–$10K/day for ICs, maximize service level: 95% on-time delivery) and constraints (e.g., production capacity, sustainability metrics like CO2 emissions).
- **Open-Source Supply Chain Simulation**: Replace SAP IBP with **AnyLogic Community Edition** (open-source for non-commercial use, [github.com/AnyLogic/anylogic-community](https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/community-edition/)) for supply chain modeling and data input.
  - **Why**: AnyLogic supports multi-echelon supply chain simulation (array, cell, module stages in TFT-LCD), enabling scenario analysis for demand, supply, and price uncertainties (web result [1]: multi-stage TFT-LCD production).
  - **TFT-LCD Application**: Model the TFT-LCD supply chain, including suppliers (e.g., Taiwan for ICs, Japan for glass), production plants, and distribution centers. Simulate disruptions (e.g., chip shortages) and price drops (30% annually, web result [1]).
  - **Implementation**: Create a simulation model to generate input data (e.g., demand forecasts, lead times) for Pymoo’s NSGA-III algorithm, ensuring robust optimization under uncertainty.
- **Open-Source Data Processing and Analytics**: Use **Pandas** and **SciPy** for data preprocessing and uncertainty quantification, replacing proprietary analytics in SAP IBP.
  - **Why**: Pandas ([github.com/pandas-dev/pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)) handles large TFT-LCD datasets (e.g., demand, lead times, prices), while SciPy ([github.com/scipy/scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)) supports statistical methods like Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty modeling.
  - **TFT-LCD Application**: Process historical data (e.g., 10,000 units/month demand ±20%, 14-day lead times ±4 days) to generate scenarios for NSGA-III fitness evaluation.
  - **Implementation**: Use Pandas to clean and aggregate TFT-LCD supply chain data, and SciPy for Monte Carlo simulations to model demand and supply uncertainties.
- **Open-Source Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing Pareto frontiers and trade-offs, replacing proprietary dashboard tools.
  - **Why**: Matplotlib ([github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)) and Seaborn ([github.com/mwaskom/seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)) are open-source, widely used for plotting multi-objective optimization results, and provide interpretable trade-offs for TFT-LCD stakeholders (e.g., planners, executives).
  - **TFT-LCD Application**: Visualize trade-offs between cost ($5K/day inventory holding), service level (95% on-time delivery), and sustainability (CO2 emissions) for IC and glass substrate inventory decisions.
  - **Implementation**: Plot NSGA-III’s Pareto frontier to show optimal inventory levels vs. delivery reliability, aiding decision-making.

**Rationale**:
- Replaces SAP IBP with open-source tools (AnyLogic, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to ensure accessibility and cost-effectiveness.
- Maintains Pymoo for its robust NSGA-III implementation, critical for TFT-LCD’s multi-objective needs.
- Aligns with TFT-LCD challenges (price volatility, short lifecycles, multi-stage production) by modeling uncertainties and visualizing trade-offs (web results [1], [2]).
- Ensures compatibility with the EMOO framework’s uncertainty-aware fitness evaluation and dynamic objective weighting.

**Integration Workflow**:
1. **Data Input**: Use AnyLogic to simulate TFT-LCD supply chain scenarios (e.g., chip shortages, 30% price drops), generating demand and lead time data.
2. **Data Processing**: Use Pandas/SciPy to preprocess data and run Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty quantification (e.g., demand ±20%, lead times ±4 days).
3. **Optimization**: Implement NSGA-III in Pymoo to optimize objectives (cost, service level, inventory turnover, sustainability) using processed data.
4. **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib/Seaborn to plot Pareto frontiers, showing trade-offs for TFT-LCD inventory and delivery decisions.
5. **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust objective weights in Pymoo based on market signals (e.g., price volatility from AnyLogic simulations), ensuring adaptability.

### Validation of Revised Tool Integration
- **Accessibility**: All tools (Pymoo, AnyLogic Community Edition, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are open-source, freely available, and actively maintained, reducing barriers for research and industry adoption.
- **TFT-LCD Relevance**: Tools address TFT-LCD-specific challenges:
  - AnyLogic models multi-stage production (array, cell, module) and disruptions (web result [1]).
  - Pandas/SciPy handle high-variability data (e.g., demand ±20%, price volatility).
  - Pymoo optimizes conflicting objectives (e.g., cost vs. service level for driver ICs).
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn provide interpretable trade-offs for stakeholders.
- **Compatibility with EMOO**: The tools support NSGA-III’s requirements (scenario generation, fitness evaluation, visualization), ensuring seamless integration.
- **Practicality**: The workflow leverages real-world TFT-LCD data (e.g., demand, lead times, prices) and aligns with web results emphasizing simulation and analytics for supply chain resilience (web results [2], [4]).
