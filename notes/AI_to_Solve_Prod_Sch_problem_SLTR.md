- dynamic scheduling program 
According to the paper, dynamic scheduling is described as: "The dynamic nature of manufacturing systems implies the necessary adoption of a dynamic scheduling paradigm to deal with unforeseen events that disrupt the execution of a schedule, as the assigned apparitions can be immediately redirected to other machines."

- Three Major Manifestations of dynamic scheduling program 
The paper identifies three key manifestations of dynamic scheduling in AI literature (citing Elbasheer et al.):

1. Task Re-scheduling: Reprogramming of specific activities within the production process as a reaction to interruptions in the original program
2. Resource Allocation: Especially in flexible shop floors, where AI improves the ability to allocate resources to deal with plan disruptions
3. Line Balancing: Balancing production lines after any interruptions in the production process
- Context and Drivers
The paper emphasizes that dynamic scheduling is necessary because:

Contemporary manufacturing settings are affected by numerous factors including:

. Machine failures
. Order fluctuations
. Unpredictable job arrivals
. Variable orders


- To be competitive, companies need to:

. Be flexible
. Respond faster to variations in production planning
. A ctively satisfy consumer wants
. Create a wide range of products

- Key Characteristics
Dynamic scheduling based on AI enables:

1. Real-time or near real-time adjustments: The ability to modify scheduling plans immediately based on current working conditions
2. Flexibility: Allowing companies to schedule several times a day and respond to abnormal events
3. Optimization of multiple KPIs:

. Reduce tardiness
. Minimize storage costs
. Minimize makespan
. Reduce travelling time
. Other company-specific KPIs

- Implementation Approaches
The paper identifies three main AI techniques for dynamic scheduling:

1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Offers high flexibility and can handle both single and multi-objective problems
2. Neural Networks (NNs): Used not just for sequencing but also `to find correlations and features that improve scheduling reliability`
3. Reinforcement Learning (RL): Particularly effective for real-time solutions, with multi-agent RL (MARL) providing better execution times than single-agent approaches

- Benefits in Practice
The paper shows that dynamic scheduling using AI has achieved:

1. Reduced calculation times (reported in 36% of analyzed cases)
2. Production cost reductions
3. Increased energy efficiency
4. Improved makespan and tardiness metrics
5. Better handling of machine failures
6. Enhanced flexibility to respond to disruptions

European AIDEAS Project Context
The paper mentions that developing a dynamic scheduling program based on AI is the major objective of the European AIDEAS project's "Fabrication Optimizer" tool, highlighting the practical importance of this technology in modern manufacturing.
In essence, dynamic scheduling based on AI represents a shift from static, predetermined production schedules to intelligent, adaptive systems that can continuously optimize production in response to real-world uncertainties and disruptions.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
