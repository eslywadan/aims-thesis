# Literature Review of integrated frameworks combining multi-objective optimization with comprehensive uncertainty modeling for IBP

## A curated summary of research and literature on integrated frameworks that combine multi-objective optimization with comprehensive uncertainty modeling, especially pertinent to Integrated Business Planning (IBP) or similar decision-making domains:

⸻

1. Systematic Reviews & Surveys in SCM/Inventory Contexts
	•	A review on Uncertainty Analysis and Optimization (UAO) in supply chain management highlights how UAO frameworks effectively tackle demand, cost, and disruption uncertainties using multi-objective models—chiefly through stochastic programming (SP), chance-constrained programming (CCP), and robust optimization (RO)  
    [Uncertainty Analysis and Optimization Modeling with Application to Supply Chain Management: A Systematic Review](../texts/mathematics-11-02530.pdf) 
	•	A focused review on robust optimization in inventory management explores integrating uncertainty via deterministic uncertainty sets (e.g., box, ellipsoidal sets), enabling planning that remains feasible under worst-case scenarios  ￼.

2. Optimization Techniques under Uncertainty
	•	Robust Fuzzy Programming (ROFP) combines fuzzy programming and robust optimization to deliver solutions that are resilient in feasibility and optimality when faced with uncertain parameters  ￼.
	•	Stochastic Programming (SP) is a classic framework where uncertain parameters follow known probability distributions—widely used across finance, transportation, energy, and more  ￼.
	•	Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) ensures constraints are satisfied with specified probabilities, critical in risk-aware planning contexts  ￼.

3. Integrated Models with Multi-Objective & Uncertainty Handling
	•	A hybrid two-stage bi-objective model combining fuzzy TOPSIS (to handle uncertainty) and mixed-integer linear programming effectively evaluates project portfolios optimizing both profit and qualitative value under uncertainty  ￼.
	•	A robust model for planning and scheduling under price uncertainty uses various uncertainty sets (box, ellipsoidal, polyhedral) and solves via a multi-level genetic algorithm to maintain optimality when prices fluctuate  [JAMP_2015012810515116.pdf](../texts/JAMP_2015012810515116.pdf)

4. Bayesian & Simulation-Based Integrated Approaches
	•	A Robust Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization framework accounts for input uncertainty by using a robust Gaussian Process and constructing a Pareto frontier that accounts for robustness  ￼.
	•	In inventory management, a novel combination of system-dynamic Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization shows promise in dynamically addressing unpredictable demand for improved stocking decisions  ￼.
	•	An Adaptive Bayesian Optimization method integrates a penalty-based robust objective to support multi-objective optimization under unpredictable business environments  ￼.

5. Applications in Energy & Distribution Network Planning
	•	A distributionally robust model predictive control (MPC) framework tackles multi-objective distribution network planning, balancing return and risk under renewable output uncertainty with notable cost and storage reductions  ￼.
	•	A bi-level model for integrated energy systems incorporates wind power uncertainty using robust optimization—upper level minimizes configuration cost, while lower-level focuses on operational cost  ￼.
	•	Another energy systems scheduling model shows how uncertainty in demand response or renewable energy affects costs and slack power, allowing planners to trade off economic efficiency and robustness  ￼.

Recommendations for IBP Research

For an IBP-focused study, combining techniques such as:
	•	Robust or distributionally robust optimization for demand/cost uncertainty,
	•	Multi-objective programming to balance commercial performance metrics,
	•	Metaheuristics or simulation-based approaches to handle complexity and dynamics,

could yield powerful integrated frameworks. Additionally, Bayesian optimization integrated with simulation or robust modeling offers a data-efficient path to robust, Pareto-optimal planning decisions.
