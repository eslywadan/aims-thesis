Based on the uploaded paper, supply chain resilience is defined and explained in several complementary ways:
Primary Definition
According to the paper, supply chain resilience refers to the ability of a supply chain "to return to its original state or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed". This core definition emphasizes the adaptive and recovery capabilities of supply chains when facing disruptions.
Expanded Understanding
The paper provides a more comprehensive definition from Kamalahmadi and Parast, describing supply chain resilience as "The adaptive capability of a supply chain to reduce the probability of facing sudden disturbances, resist the spread of disturbances by maintaining control over structures and functions, and recover and respond by immediate and effective reactive plans to transcend the disturbance and restore the supply chain to a robust state of operations".
Key Characteristics
Supply chain resilience encompasses several critical aspects:

Mitigation and Response: It implies the supply chain's ability to mitigate, respond to, and recover from risks that cause mismatches between demand and supply.
Measurable Outcomes: The supply chain is more resilient if the possibility of mismatches is lower, the duration is shorter, or the state after recovery is better.

Context and Importance
The paper emphasizes that supply chain resilience has become increasingly critical due to:

Global Interconnectedness: As the world grows increasingly interconnected, global disruptions such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) significantly and lastingly impact supply chain logistics, suppliers, and workforce
Cascading Effects: Local disturbances, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, as well as sudden shifts in inflation, market trends, political policies, and climate changes, can similarly influence global supply chain operations due to their cascading effects
Unknown Unknowns: Supply chain members are increasingly encountering events for the first time, where neither the probability nor the impact of risks is known, thereby escalating uncertainties and disruption risks towards unknown unknowns

Practical Implementation
The paper identifies that supply chain resilience is achieved through various inventory management strategies, including:

Stockpiling and inventory pre-positioning
Multi-sourcing strategies
Capacity reservation
Flexible supply contracts

These strategies are categorized into two main approaches:

Demand-side strategies: Dealing with demand surges and disruptions
Supply-side strategies: Managing supply disruptions and uncertainties

In essence, supply chain resilience represents a supply chain's comprehensive ability to anticipate, withstand, respond to, and recover from disruptions while maintaining operational continuity and potentially emerging stronger from the experience.
