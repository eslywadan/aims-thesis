    "## Key Optimality Proofs and Verification Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Theoretical Lower Bounds**\n",
    "- **Job-based bound**: `max(sum of processing times per job)`\n",
    "- **Machine-based bound**: `max(total load per machine)`\n",
    "- **Critical path bound**: Longest path through precedence constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Solver Optimality Gap**\n",
    "- OR-Tools provides `BestObjectiveBound()` (lower bound)\n",
    "- Gap = 0 + Status = OPTIMAL → **Proven optimal**\n",
    "- Small gap → **Near-optimal** with quality guarantee\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Pareto Frontier Verification**\n",
    "- Solve with alternative objectives (total completion time, flow time, etc.)\n",
    "- Show that improving other objectives **worsens makespan**\n",
    "- Demonstrates current solution is **non-dominated**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Optimality Ratio Analysis**\n",
    "- Compare achieved makespan to theoretical lower bound\n",
    "- Ratio ≤ 1.1 → Excellent quality\n",
    "- Ratio ≤ 1.3 → Good quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this, you should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple 2x2**: Likely **proven optimal** (small problem)\n",
    "2. **Beer Brewery**: May be **proven optimal** or **near-optimal**\n",
    "3. **Trade-off Analysis**: Shows improving other objectives increases makespan\n",
    "\n",
    "This proves the solutions are on the **Pareto frontier** - you cannot improve any objective without worsening others, which is the definition of optimality in multi-objective optimization!"
