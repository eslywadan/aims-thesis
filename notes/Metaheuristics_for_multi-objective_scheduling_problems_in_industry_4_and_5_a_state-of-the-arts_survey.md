- [fieng-1-1540022](../texts/fieng-1-1540022.pdf)
## Highlights
*(1)* This paper focuses on the application of metaheuristic algorithms in multi-objective scheduling problems from 2015 to 2024, systematically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of single algorithms and hybrid algorithms found in the existing literature.

*(2)* By conducting an in-depth analysis of the number of objectives across various studies, this paper explores scheduling goals in the context of Industry 5.0 and Industry 4.0, distilling the current scale of research objectives and the trends for future research goals.
*(3)* This paper provides an overview of the research progress on metaheuristic algorithms combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in scheduling problems, assesses the advantages of these combined approaches, and suggests potential directions for future research.
*(4)* Addressing the classiﬁcation of scheduling problems, this paper summarizes and examines the current trends in scheduling issues from the perspectives of ﬂow-shop and job-shop scheduling problems.
